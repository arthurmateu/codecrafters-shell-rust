This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

The challenge consists of building your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo` and more. Alongside learning about shell command parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

Please note I've also tried building the project [in Python](https://github.com/arthurmateu/codecrafters-shell-python).
